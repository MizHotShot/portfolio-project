                <h2>About Ariel</h2>
                <!-- Set up javascript to accurately show age in real time-->
                <p>I'm an x year old artist who grew up in both Queens and Long Island, New York. I've been classically trained in both fine art and design, however the majority of what I know is entirely self taught. After spending years of doing commission work I realized I'd prefer to do art I want rather than what others want. Then I picked up coding.</p>
                <p>After getting certified on Codecademy for Front End Dev Engineering, I can now merge my interest in design as well as the challenge of coding.</p>
                <p>These days I mostly code, draw for fun, or playing video games. I get bored staying on the same thing for too long so I'm always teaching myself something new. Most people would say staying glued to their computers is a curse, not me.</p>
